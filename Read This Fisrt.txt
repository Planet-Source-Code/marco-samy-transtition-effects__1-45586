hi every body
this is a simple FX engine using GetDIbits and setDIbits, to make some transtition effects on some photos when making a slide show
this engine is 100 % depends on GetDIbits and SetDIBits, so you can simply add your own custom effect by :
-add it's name in the enum Effects in module "EffectEXE"
-add it's function in the same module
  to make a new effect, only you have to fix some points, where to draw, where to take from the first photo and where to take from the second one
-add it's case in the FXShows.cls Class, form Select Case Partin the function "ExecuteEffect"

and thank you for downloadin' my code
I hope you enjoy, and vote.
